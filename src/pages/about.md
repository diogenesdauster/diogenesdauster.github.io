Software Developer very fascinated about software architecture. I'm a person who likes hardworking for solving issues and always is learn something new. I have knowledge about FullStack Development, Mobile Development and Totvs ERP. Recently a took a Mobile Post-Graduation and a nanodegree in the Udacity to deep my knowledge. I started my developer career when I was a teenager and since then I've been learning how can I be a better developer. Making simple code for the others, taking care about what I write to avoid issue and doing test as many as possible.
